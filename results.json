  "about":"The Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences, the forebear of the Brooklyn Museum, was conceived in the nineteenth century as the focal point of a planned cultural, recreational, and educational district for the burgeoning city of Brooklyn. Although the scope of that envisioned complex of parks, gardens, and buildings changed after the once-independent Brooklyn was absorbed into New York City in 1898, many features of the plan were eventually realized and are reflected in what can be seen today. In the area of land once designated as the Brooklyn Institute Triangle can be found not only the Brooklyn Museum but also such other institutions and facilities as the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, the Prospect Park Zoo, Mount Prospect Park, and the Central Library of the Brooklyn Public Library system. Just beyond the western edge of the Institute Triangle complex stands the monumental entrance to Prospect Park, marked by the Soldiers' and Sailors' Memorial Arch in the center of Grand Army Plaza."

Routinely booking acts that usually play rooms 2 or 3 times the size – the “Underground” gives the discerning music lover a chance to see some of the world’s greatest performers in an utterly intimate setting. We like the description that Citysearch has written.Surrounded by side booths and candle-lit tables, the intimate club’s low stage is bathed in blue light. A step up in the rear–where political posters on naked brick walls recall the Village’s radical bohemian past–more tables, ample standing room and a long, polished bar accommodate the crowd. Sight lines and sound are impeccable.'"
